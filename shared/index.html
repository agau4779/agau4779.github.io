      <h1>House Stuff</h1>
      <h3>Wifi</h3>
      Gakkou School Time
      <br/>
      <span class="code">$sanity during quarantine</span>
      <h3>TV</h3>
      <p>
      	Our TV is hooked up to an Ubuntu computer. If it ever restarts, the password is <span class="code">uwuowouwuowo</span>. Use the file finder under Videos/ to find downloaded anime. Use Firefox to watch Youtube, Netflix, or whatever else you want.
      </p>
      <p>
      	The media player that plays downloaded videos is SMPlayer. Use the <span class="code">0</span> or <span class="code">9</span> keys to increase / decrease the volume. Use the <span class="code">[</span> or <span class="code">]</span> keys to increase / decrease playback speed. More keyboard shortcuts <a href="https://defkey.com/smplayer-shortcuts">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
      	Volume controls via remote control are deliberately disabled. You should change the volume via the sound mixer that sits below the TV or in whatever software is running on the TV, like Netflix, SMPlayer, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        To play the Switch: Plug in your Switch and turn it on. Use the remote control to switch the HDMI input. I think it's #2?
      </p>
      <h3>Cats</h3>
      <p>
      	Fill ~1/3 to 1/2 of the food balls next to the TV. I usually do this in the morning. 
      	<br/>
      	1/2 of a can of 5.5oz wet food daily at 5pm. Feeding stations are the white plates near the dry food.
      </p>
      <p>
      	Make sure their water fountain has water. I use the Brita pitcher. The water fountain will be louder and make a "groaning" noise if it is low on water.
      </p>
      <p>
      	Litter scoopers are automatic. They do sometimes get "stuck" - as in the light indicator will flash repeatedly. All you need to do is press the button to make it scoop, and make sure it returns to the resting position and stops flashing. Other than that, you do not need to mess with them. I replace them with litter crystals, roughly an inch tall, when they hit ~50 usages and reset the counter.
      </p>
      <p>
      	For the AnimalBiome program, I use a ziploc bag and scoop or use disposable chopsticks to pick up poo and put it in the little cooler outside the apartment every morning before 9:30AM. It is okay if they do not poo once in a while. The cooler is strapped to a tree with a bicycle lock. Exit the front door, turn right. Recommend wearing shoes to step onto the woodchips to deposit the poo.
      </p>
      <p>
      	Porch access - the cats do get porch time with us, but they have to be supervised. You can quickly duck into the kitchen to get a drink or food, but make sure your eyes are on them. Vega is very well-behaved and knows to return home as a safe space. Ko when too excited tends to jump on the bannister. Sometimes she is a little shit and rolls around the floor and refuses to come inside. You then need to either bait her with a toy (or makeshift toy made of ripping off a Spider Plant stalk) or grab her and throw her in. If you dont feel confident doing this, recommend not taking them outside. Vega will try and yell at you to take her out, but be strong.
